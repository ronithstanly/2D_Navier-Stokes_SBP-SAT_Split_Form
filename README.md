# 2D_Navier-Stokes_SBP-SAT_Split_Form
This code solves the 2-D Compressible Navier-Stokes equations using Summation by Parts (SBP) operators, 
Simultaneous Approximation Term (SAT) boundary conditions and Kennedy & Gruber (2008) Split-form fluxes.
Second, fourth and sixth-order accurate SBP operators are available. 
The default test case selected is the Lid Driven cavity at Re=100.
More details about the details of implementation starting with the 1-D scalar equation upto the 2-D CNSE and the associated challenges that were faced during its implementation are detailed in the accompanying PDF document. Detailed equations, matrices and references are also provided.
